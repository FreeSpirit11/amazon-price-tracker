# Amazon Price Tracker

Welcome to the Amazon Price Tracker repository! This Python script monitors the price of a specific Amazon product. When the price drops below a set threshold, an email alert is sent.

## How It Works

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/FreeSpirit11/amazon-price-tracker.git`
2. Install Python and required libraries: `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests`
3. Set up your email credentials and adjust the product URL and price threshold.
4. Customize the request headers to mimic a web browser.
5. Run the script: `python main.py`
6. Stay updated with Amazon deals via email alerts!
